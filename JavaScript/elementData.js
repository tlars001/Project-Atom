It is the main component of all organic matter and water. Industrial production of hydrogen takes place by steam reforming of natural gas. Electrolysis of water and other energy-intensive hydrogen production techniques are less often used. In terms of chemical properties, molecular hydrogen or dihydrogen (hydrogen gas) is highly flammable. It burns in air in different concentrations, ranging from 4 percent up to 75 percent by volume. Explosive mixtures form with air in concentration between 4 and 74 percent. Concentration of 5 to 95 percent forms explosive mixtures with chlorine. Ultraviolet light is emitted by pure hydrogen-oxygen flames, and they are almost invisible to the naked eye.

It is combined with elements such as sulfur, chlorine, and oxygen and forms different inorganic arsenic compounds. Exposure to levels of arsenic that are higher-than-overage may occur in water, rocks, and soils with naturally occurring high levels. Exposure is also possible in or near hazardous waste sites and workplaces close to such areas. Long-term exposure to low levels of arsenic can result in the appearance of small-size warts and corns and discoloration of the skin. High levels of arsenic are dangerous to human health and can cause death. Exposures to this element are addressed in industry-specific standards for the construction industry, shipyard employment, and the general industry."

However, the French chemist Marignac was the first to observe traces of samarium in 1853. This element is a soft metal with moderate paramagnetic properties. It is stable in air and solid at room temperature. Its Van Der Waals radius and ionic radius are unknown. Stable in dry air, oxide coating forms at higher humidity levels. When it oxidizes, it forms powder in gray-yellow that consists of hydroxides and oxides. The best way to store the metal is under argon or another inert gas. There are 21 known isotopes and samarium forms different compounds, including borides, halides, chalcogenides, and oxides. The element also has nuclear isomers and radioisotopes and stable isotopes such as Sm-154, Sm-152, Sm-150, Sm-144, and others. Some isotopes have a half life of 340 days while others, for example, Sm-153 have a half life of just 1.92 days."

It can accumulate in the liver, lungs, and bones and cause cancer. All the isotopes of this element are radioactive.
