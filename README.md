# Project Atom
The purpose of Project Atom is to have a web application that gives the user a visual experience with what atoms really look like. Any element on the periodic table can be selected. When an element has been selected, it will be generated for the user to observe. Information is presented about the element as well as other settings that can give the user a better experience learning about each element.
